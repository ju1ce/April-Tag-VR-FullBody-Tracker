Move the camera around slowly.\n\nPurple dots = great\nGreen dots = okay\nYellow dots = bad\n\nThe grid should be fairly flat, fairly stable (can still shake a couple of pixels) and take over the whole image.\nThe dots should be spread across the whole image\n\nPress OK to save calibration when done."

TRACKER_CAMERA_NOTCALIBRATED: Camera not calibrated
TRACKER_TRACKER_CALIBRATION_INSTRUCTIONS: "Tracker calibration started!\n\nBefore calibrating, set the number of trackers and marker size parameters (measure the white square). Make sure the trackers are completely rigid and cannot bend,\nneither the markers or at the connections between markers - use images on github for reference. Wear your trackers, then calibrate them by moving them to the camera closer than 30cm.\n\nGreen: This marker is calibrated and can be used to calibrate other markers.\nBlue: This marker is not part of any used trackers. You probably have to increase number of trackers in params.\nPurple: This marker is too far from the camera to be calibrated. Move it closer than 30cm.\nRed: This marker cannot be calibrated as no green markers are seen. Rotate the tracker until a green marker is seen along this one.\nYellow: The marker is being calibrated. Hold it still for a second.\n\nWhen all the markers on all trackers are shown as green, press OK to finish calibration."
